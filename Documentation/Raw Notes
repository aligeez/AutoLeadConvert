Amsterdam Community Day - Automate Lead Conversion – April 4, 2019

Problem: 
•	Today converting a lead to an Account/Donor/Contact/Student is very manual. Salesforce core considers an actual salesperson that is doing the conversion.
•	In Fundraising it is small values, high volume of donations. It is a very automated process but Salesforce Lead conversion is not automating. 
o	Look up leads, convert it to Contact/Household, and create Opportunity (for gift). 


Notes:
•	Do we need to search current contacts first? – Yes 
•	At times leads need to fall back – as in the school’s program is full and they need to fall back and wait. 
•	Dutch student model:
o	Attention  Interest  Urgency  Action

•	What triggers a lead conversion should be configurable. 
o	What IS a Lead?
o	Where in the Lead process do you want to flip?
•	Trigger lead directly by flow or API


Triggers/Settings, functionality that you would set on your automation dashboard –keep it aligned with process builder. 

Post conversion actions - what happens after the lead is converted. 
Would be nice to have an API call to have a direct conversion.

MVP - Interface/possibilities/initial settings / 
Decision: What is your conversion criteria 
SOQL Query as criteria: e.g. All Leads value = 2
One checkbox - Convert or a whole lead-scoring criteria list
Or a direct Trigger - API call to convert it. Example, a Donation page is making the call. For Education it would be filling out an application form, visit a campus tour, or anything. 

We need to find away to keep the custom parts (forms, API, etc.) from the core functionality. 
There is a definable action (customer picks) that is set.
There needs to be an initial query to search for existing contacts or leads that match, before converting the lead.
